# This is the analysis of Kickstarter campaigns requested by the client. 
## Hello Louise, please find the results of our analysis and recommendations below. Thank you.

*The months with the highest number of successful Kickstarter campaigns are May and June. A number of factors could contribute to this and could be evaluated with further analysis. We recommend you initiate any Kickstarter campaign in these months. Please see the following chart ![Outcomes Based On Launch](docs/Outcomes Based On Launch.png)
*Further analysis showed us that the highest number of successful Kickstarter campaigns were classified in the parent category of "Theater". Please note that this is a broad category which includes subcategories for "plays", "musicals", and "spaces". Theater projects is a very successful category as displayed in the following bar graph ![Parent Category Outcomes.png](docs/Parent Category Outcomes.png)
*We recommend keeping your Kickstarter project goal around the US average which is approximately $5,000. This will place your project in the 75 percentile of successful projects. As a cautionary note, failed US projects have an avrage goal of around $10,000 with some very high outliers. The bottom line is that the higher your goal amount (particularly above $5,000) the more the likelyhood of failure.
*Regarding our analysis of Musicals in Great Britain. We strongly recommend reconsidering your planned goal of $4,000 funding for a musical in Great Britain. Our analysis shows that $4,000 is beyond the upper limits of successful pledged amounts. $2,000 is a more realistic goal amount while it is still in the upper quartile for pledged projects.
